## About this blog series

It's easy to find on the internet the awesome stuff that can be done with Neovim, a bunch of customizations, excellent plugins, and, best of all: writing at the speed of thought.

However, achieving such greatness can sometimes feel impossible. While Neovim can offer a lot, it requires effort and time to set it up and customize it to your liking.

In the past, I've found myself countless times trying to set Neovim as an IDE just to be overwhelmed and confused by all the needed information to do it properly.

Some might think it's overcomplicated to spend time configuring your IDE (I was one of those people). We want to be productive as soon as we open the editor. But you realize that in the long run, the time invested in creating what [TJ DeVries](https://twitter.com/teej_dv) (Neovim's core maintainer) calls PDE (Personalized Development Environment) will allow you to become highly productive the more you make the IDE your own.

This blog series is what I'd liked to have available when starting my Neovim journey. I'll explain in detail whatever we do, no mindless copy/paste. I want you to understand what we are doing so you later know how to do stuff your way. I hope you find this helpful.

## Knowledge Requirements

I don't expect you to be 10x engineer to follow along. However, some foundational knowledge will be helpful while going through the posts.

For example, I expect you to know basic terminal commands and how to move around in Vim/Neovim, the different modes it has, how to navigate using `j,k,h,l`, and most importantly, how to quit Vim/Neovim.

## Installation

We first need to install Neovim on our computer to start our journey. My preferred way of doing it is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). However, if you'd like to use a different method, you can check the available options in the [documentation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim). It is also important that the version installed is 0.9.1+. If you already installed Neovim with a previous version, you will need to update it.

We will also need to install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). If you're wondering what's that, it's a collection of fonts modified to have icons added to them. It will be helpful later down the road to have icons displayed to us depending on file extensions. So using Homebrew, run the following command.

```sh
brew install neovim
```

To confirm that you got it installed, you can run the following command, and you should get a version number displayed.

```sh
nvim -v
```

To update Neovim using Homebrew run.

```sh
brew upgrade neovim
```

Now to install Nerd Fonts, we are also going to use Homebrew. As fonts are not part of Hombrew's core, we first need to `tap` into the correct repository and install the desired font later.

This installation method not only works for Nerd Fonts. You can install various fonts this way, and you can check the [repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts/tree/master/Casks) to see which ones are available.

Tap into the Cask Fonts repo

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
```

Install Nerd Fonts

```sh
brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

With that out, now is the time to start the long but fun configuration process.

## Starting our configuration

Neovim can be run anywhere in our terminal emulator using `nvim` command. We can just run `nvim` and we will be shown the following screen.

```sh
nvim
```

![Neovim starting screen](~/assets/neovim-part-one/neovim-start-screen.png)

This only gives us a little info, just some Ex commands we can run.

> [!info] Info
> Ex commands are keys or words to perform certain tasks while in Command Line mode. To get into Command Line mode while in Normal mode press the colon key `:` and your cursor should change to the bottom of the window. Then, you can type commands that you want to execute.

> So whenever you see `:somethinglikethis` in anything related to Vim/Neovim, now you know it is an ex command and how to run it.

I created a starter repository, which is a basic [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1) app. You don't need to know Remix. The goal of the repository is to explore Neovim features and the plugins we install. You can find a link to the repo [here](https://github.com/ddanielcruzz/neovim-remix).

Once you have cloned the starter repository, and after you are inside of it, you can run `nvim .`, This means "open Neovim in the current working directory" and we will be presented with the following screen

![Neovim Netrw screen](~/assets/neovim-part-one/neovim-netrw.png)

That is Netrw Vim's native file explorer. We can move around with the same motions as files meaning `j,k,l,h`, and hit `Enter` to open directories and files. Open the `app` directory and then the `routes` directory, and finally the `_index.tsx` file

![Neovim Netrw _index.tsx](~/assets/neovim-part-one/neovim-at-index.png)

Your color scheme may differ depending on your terminal settings, but if you try to edit this file, you can spot right away that we don't have much of the sweetness of an IDE. No autocompletion, line numbers, syntax highlighting leaves much to be desired, etc.

### Standard Paths and init.lua

Neovim supports having a configuration file to customize the editor. This file can be written in either Vimscript or Lua. However, we will do our configuration using Lua, which in my opinion, is easier to understand and maintain.

> [!warning] Warning
> The support for Lua as a configuration file is something implemented in Neovim and not supported by Vim as of the writing of this post.

Neovim follows XDG Base Directory Specification, meaning that it stores information related to it in standard locations.

I'll tell you the paths where we need to store our configuration throughout the series. If you want to know more in advance, check [Neovim's docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#standard-path)

The three things that we need Neovim our own are:

- Options
- Keybindings
- Plugins

The path where we need to store our Neovim configuration and put the three things we need is `~/.config/nvim`. If you already have installed applications that follow XDG Specification, you will likely already have a `.config` directory in your home directory. If not, create one, and inside it, create another directory called `nvim`. This directory is where we will put the files and directories that do all the magic.

Start by creating an `init.lua` file. This file will be an entry point to require other Lua modules and make our configuration easier to maintain. For now, let's put some options inside it to make sure our configuration works.

The way to set options in Neovim is through `vim.opt.optionname`, if we want to set numbers in our editor we can do it with `vim.opt.number = true`. After saving and sourcing our init.lua file, we will see the changes

Type the following

```lua
-- init.lua file
vim.opt.number = true
```

Then save the file by running ex command `:w`

And source the current file with the ex command `:source %`

> [!info] Info
> In Neovim, the command ":source %" is used to reload the current file that is open in the editor. The "%" symbol is a shortcut that represents the current file. The "source" command is used to execute the contents of the file, in this case, our init.lua file

After that, you should see number lines in your editor.

![Neovim options setting line number](~/assets/neovim-part-one/neovim-opt-number.png)

Now that we know that our config is working, we will create some directories to help make our configuration more manageable. I'm also going to give a quick explanation of how Lua modules work in Neovim.

Inside `~/.config/nvim`, create a directory named `lua`; inside that directory, make another one with either your username or just the word `user`. Finally, inside that directory, create a file called `options.lua`.

In the end, you should have this file structure.

```
ðŸ“¦ ~
â””â”€Â .config
Â Â Â â””â”€Â nvim
Â Â Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€Â init.lua
Â Â Â Â Â Â â””â”€Â lua
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â””â”€Â user
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â””â”€Â options.lua
```

Cut and paste `vim.opt.number` from `init.lua` into `options.lua`. After saving both files, you will notice that our line numbers are gone. That's because the entry point for our configuration is `init.lua`, and the rest of what we created is only helpful for us and not for Neovim.

Inside of `init.lua` type

```lua
require("user.options")
```

Again, we need to save and source `init.lua` for the changes to appear. We will do it with a shortcut of the command we already saw, `:so %` where "so" stands for "source".

Line numbers should be showing again.

Effectively, what we are doing is calling the Lua function `require` and passing it the path of our option configuration.

If you pay close attention, you'll realize that there are a couple strange things:

- First, we are calling the function from `init.lua`, which is sibling with `lua` directory and not `user` directory
- We omitted the `.lua` extension

This is because, by default, Neovim will prepend `/lua` and append `.lua` to our string when using the `require` function. It is also worth mentioning that Neovim uses a variable called `runtimepath` to look for configuration and script files, and specifically for Lua modules it will look in `runtimepath/lua/`.

> [!info] Info
> `runtimepath` is a string containing a list of directories. You can check its value by running `:lua print(vim.o.runtimepath)`. Learn more in Neovim's [documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath')

Also worth mentioning that we use dots instead of slashes to go down the file tree, this is to follow Lua's module conventions.

We are leave our current options file with only the line number option for now, and come back to it later in another post.

In the next post we are going to learn what a plugin manager is, install one (Packer), and begin installing basic plugins to understand how they work.
